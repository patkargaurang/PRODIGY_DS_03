# PRODIGY_DS_03
## Objective
   My third internship task as Data Science Intern at Prodigy InfoTech, focused on deploying a Decision Tree Classifier.

## Overview
   This project analyzes a bank marketing dataset to explore customer demographics and behaviors, with a focus on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data preprocessing and visualization, the project delves into feature engineering by categorizing job types and analyzing their impact on account balances. A Decision Tree Classifier is then employed to model the data, with accuracy assessments both before and after applying cost complexity pruning to optimize the model's performance.

## Conclusion
  In conclusion, the analysis of the bank marketing dataset using decision tree classifiers provided insightful findings on customer demographics and their likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. Through detailed data preprocessing and visualization, key patterns and correlations were identified, such as the impact of job types on account balances. The decision tree model, enhanced by cost complexity pruning, demonstrated a reliable predictive performance, highlighting its potential for practical application in targeted marketing strategies. This project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding and anticipating customer behaviors, ultimately aiding in more effective decision-making processes.
